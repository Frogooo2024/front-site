        <h3>5. Targeted Advertising</h3>
        <p>
          Where permitted by local law, Frogooo and third-party service providers may use cookies,
          pixel tags, web beacons, invisible pixels or similar technologies to track the behavior of
          Site users and email recipients across non- Frogooo affiliated sites over time in order to
          present advertising that is more relevant to the user and to provide the user with a
          personalized experience on the Site . For example, we use third-party service providers to
          display products and offers that are customized based on the preferences and interests
          that a user has demonstrated through his or her online activities over time. If a user
          does not want to receive personalized ads from third-party advertisers and ad networks
          that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or that adhere to the Digital
          Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising, the
          user may visit the opt-out pages on the NAI website and the DAA website . The user
          understands that these opt-out mechanisms are maintained by the third parties, not by
          Frogooo . Frogooo is not responsible for and does not control such mechanisms of third
          parties that choose to participate in these opt-out programs.

          are called "first party cookies" because they are placed by Frogooo itself) and other
          third parties (these cookies are called "third party cookies" because they are not placed
          by Frogooo ).

        <span
          >First-party cookies are set by the website the user is visiting and can only be read by

        <p>
          Third-party cookies and website analytics. We use third-party services, including Google
          Analytics, to analyze website activity. When a user visits the Website, Google Analytics
          automatically collects information about the user and provides some of this information to
          us through the use of Google Analytics IDs. A Google Analytics ID is a unique string of
          numbers and letters (often referred to simply as a "string") that is assigned to a user 's
          computer or device, but does not specify the user 's name. The Google Analytics ID allows
          Google to track Website usage data such as the date and time of visits, duration of
          visits, website traffic patterns, "clickstreams," other similar information about a user
          's use of the Website, the type of web browser used, the operating system/platform used,
          the user 's IP address, the website that referred or linked the user to our Website, and
          the user 's CPU speed. Google Analytics does not share the Google Analytics ID assigned to
          a user 's computer or device used to access and use the Website. Google Analytics provides
          us with information about Website usage in an aggregate form ( i.e., data combined across
          many Website users, not just data for a single user ). Some of this data may include the
          regional location of a Website user, but again, this data will be in an aggregate (not
          individual) form. We rely on this aggregate data to understand how users use the Site and
          to help us improve the Site.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social Media Widget Cookies. Certain pages on our Site include social media features, such
          as the Facebook "Like" button and widgets, such as the "Share This" button or interactive
          mini-programs that run on our Site. This may collect a user 's IP address and which page
          the user is visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function
          properly. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party or hosted
          directly on the Site. Please see the Social Media section under the "How We Share Personal
          Information" heading below for more details about user interactions with these features on
          our Site.
        </p>
        <p>The type of cookie.  The different types of cookies can be categorised as follows:</p>
        <h4>
          Necessary cookies: We must include some cookies in order for certain web pages to function
          properly. Therefore, they do not require user consent. In particular:
        </h4>
        <span
          >Necessary cookies are cookies required for the operation of our website, such as cookies
          used to ensure security. Other necessary cookies allow us to provide features or services
          that users have explicitly requested. These cookies do not require the user 's consent and
          cannot be turned off (although in some cases, users can change their request). Users can
          set their browser to block these cookies, or alert users about them, but if users block
          these types of cookies, some parts of our website may not work properly.</span
        >
        <span>
          Functionality cookies are used to provide users with certain features by recording their
          choices and settings for our services , retaining their preferences over time, and
          identifying them when they return to our website so that we can provide users with a
          better experience on this website. We will only do so if the user agrees that we can store
          and access functionality cookies on the user 's device. If the user does not agree to the
          use of these types of cookies, we will not be able to provide certain features to the user
          .</span
        >
        <p>
          Non-essential cookies: We use these cookies only for internal research purposes to
          understand how we can improve our website and better serve our users. These cookies only
          evaluate a user 's interaction with our website as an anonymous user (i.e. the data
          collected does not personally identify the user ).
        </p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, this data will not be shared with any third party or used for any other
          purpose. Anonymous statistical data may be shared with contractors working on
          communications projects under contract with Frogooo . However, users can refuse these
          types of cookies by clicking on the cookie banner they see when they first visit the site
          or by visiting the cookie preferences page.

        <p>
          Performance cookies are used to improve the performance of our website and the user
          experience. Google Analytics automatically collects certain usage and performance data
          from our website users. The information collected by these cookies is aggregated and
          anonymous, and we will never obtain personal information from users through these cookies
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Analytical cookies allow us to analyse the use of our website and understand how visitors
          use it. These cookies identify and collect information about the number of visitors, the
          pages they viewed, how long they viewed a page, and how they moved around our website when
          they used it. This helps us improve our website, for example, by ensuring that visitors
          can easily find what they are looking for. We will only store and access analytical
          cookies if you have consented to this . If you do not consent to the use of these types of
          cookies, we will not be able to improve our website based on information from your visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Targeting and advertising cookies track browsing habits and are used to deliver targeted
          (interest-based) advertising. They are also used to limit the number of times a user sees
          an advert and to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They are typically
          placed by advertising networks with the website operator's permission. They remember which
          websites a user has visited and this information can be shared with other organisations
          such as advertisers.
        </p>
        <h4>Managing Cookies and Withdrawing Consent</h4>
        <p>
          When a user first visits the Site, and when we introduce any new cookies to the Site, we
          will ask for the user 's opt-in consent to use non-essential cookies and other tracking
          technologies on the Site, with the exception of essential cookies, for which we do not
          have to ask for the user 's consent. The user will see a pop-up window when visiting the
          Site that explains our use of such cookies. The user can then consent by clicking "Accept"
          or refuse cookies other than essential cookies by clicking "Accept only essential
          cookies".
        </p>
        <p>The user can revoke the user 's consent at any time with effect for the future.</p>
        <p>
          If a user refuses cookies, then we will not set those cookies on the user 's device, with
          the exception of necessary cookies and those designed to remember that the user does not
          wish any cookies to be set while visiting this website.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user has accepted cookies but wishes to reject them in the future (revoke the user
          's consent), these cookies can be deleted in the website browser and in the cookie banner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies and Browser Settings. Users can disable cookies by changing their website browser
          settings to reject cookies. How this is done will depend on the browser they use.
          Rejecting cookies will prevent their browser from accepting new cookies and (depending on
          how sophisticated their browser software is) allow them to decide in various ways whether
          to accept each new cookie. Users can also delete all cookies already on their device.
          However, if they do this, they may need to manually adjust certain preferences each time
          they visit this website . All modern browsers allow users to change their cookie settings,
          usually by going into the "options" or "preferences" menu of their browser. For more
          information, please use the "Help" option in your browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blocking all cookies (including essential cookies) will negatively impact the usability of
          many websites, including ours. If a user blocks essential cookies, the user may not be
          able to use all of the features of this website. The user can also delete cookies that
          have already been stored on the user 's computer. However, deleting cookies may negatively
          impact the usability of many websites, including ours.

        <h3>6. International Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          Frogooo primarily stores personal information we collect in the United States. To
          facilitate Frogooo 's global operations, we and/or our service providers may transfer and
          access users ' personal information from around the world. This may involve transferring
          users ' personal information outside the country/region where the user resides. For
          example, we may use servers hosted overseas to store data, which may include users '
          personal information. Users ' personal information may also be processed by employees or
          other third parties working for us, or by representatives and employees of our parent
          company, affiliates or other subsidiaries. If we transfer users ' personal information to
          third parties located in other countries/regions, we will do so only if the third party
          provides adequate protection as required by law and only if it is necessary to perform our
          obligations or with the user's explicit consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is
          treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. We only share personal
          information with third parties that have fully implemented appropriate technical and
          organizational measures to protect your rights in accordance with the laws that apply to
          you . We have described the different categories of third parties with whom we may share
          your personal information in Section 4 of this Privacy Statement entitled " How we share
          your personal information ", and we may also have a legal obligation to share your
          information with government agencies .

        <h4>
          For example, if you reside in the European Economic Area (EEA), Australia, Indonesia or
          China, if we transfer your personal information outside of your region, we will ensure
          that one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </h4>
        <span
          >We will only transfer your personal information to countries that are deemed to provide
          an adequate level of protection for personal information (for example, in the European
          Economic Area, such countries are determined by the European Commission); or</span
        >
        <span
          >We may use specific contracts, approved by law, that provide the same protection to
          personal information as it has in the user’s country; or</span
        >
        <span
          >We will ensure that certain other safeguards are in place, which are approved by law and
          ensure that personal information is afforded the same protection as in the user 's
          country. </span

        <h3>7. User Rights and Choices</h3>
        <p>
          users have rights under applicable data protection laws with respect to their personal
          information. Users have the right to:
        </p>
        <p>
          Know what personal information we hold. Users may have the right to know what personal
          information is being collected about them , whether it is disclosed, and to whom it is
          disclosed. If users have questions, they also have the right to ask us to explain our
          personal information processing regulations and policies to them .
        </p>
        <p>
          Access user 's personal information.  Users can request access to their personal
          information. This enables users to receive a copy of the personal information we hold
          about them and to check that we are lawfully processing it. Users can reasonably access
          their personal information by contacting the Frogooo Privacy Office . Please note that we
          may ask users to provide specific information to enable us to confirm the user 's identity
          and access rights, as well as to search for and provide users with the personal
          information we hold about them .
        </p>
        <p>
          users to access the personal information we hold about them is not absolute. In certain
          circumstances, applicable laws or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refuse to
          provide some or all of the personal information we hold about you . In addition, the
          personal information may have been destroyed, deleted or anonymized. If we are unable to
          provide you with access to your personal information, we will inform you of the reasons ,
          subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions .
        </p>
        <p>
          Modify or update your personal information. We aim to ensure that the personal information
          we hold is accurate, current and complete. If you believe that personal information about
          you is incorrect, incomplete or out of date, you may request that that information be
          modified or corrected. We will make reasonable efforts to amend it and, if necessary, to
          notify agents, service providers or other third parties to whom we obtained inaccurate
          information so that their records may also be corrected or updated. However, we reserve
          the right not to change any personal information that we believe is accurate or necessary
          for our records.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deleting your personal information. You can ask us to delete or remove your personal
          information if we have no legitimate reason to continue using it. You also have the right
          to ask us to delete or remove your personal information if you have successfully exercised
          your right to object to processing (see below), if our processing of your information may
          be unlawful, or if we are legally required to delete your personal information. Please
          note that we may not always be able to comply with your deletion request for specific
          legal reasons , which we will notify you of if applicable at the time of your request .
        </p>
        <p>
          Object to processing of your personal information. In certain circumstances, you may have
          the right to object to us processing your information. This right applies where we process
          your personal information based on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) , and
          you can challenge this processing if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and
          freedoms . You also have the right to object to us processing your personal information
          for direct marketing purposes . However, in some cases we may demonstrate that we have
          compelling legitimate grounds to process your information or a legal obligation that
          overrides your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right to data portability.  You can ask us to transfer your personal information to
          you or a third party. We will provide you , or a third party you have chosen, your
          information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format . Please note that
          this right only applies to automated information which you initially consented for us to
          use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you .

          charge) a different price or rate, or penalizes residents for exercising their privacy
          rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value that the personal data provides
          to the business.

          security of our other data or changing our other data. If we cannot meet any part of the
          user 's request, we will inform the user of this in our response and explain why we cannot
          meet the user 's request.

        <p>
          Verifying the User 's Identity : To protect users and their information, we may ask users
          to confirm certain information before we fulfill a user 's request. For example, if a user
          makes a request, we will ask the user to confirm the user 's name, email address, and
          phone number. For certain requests, we will use a combination of the user 's name, email
          address, phone number, zip code, address, and/or date of birth to verify the user 's
          identity so that we can assist in protecting the user 's information. If a user designates
          an authorized agent or attorney to make a request on the user 's behalf , we may ask the
          user to verify the user 's identity and provide us with the authorized agent's or
          attorney's identity and contact information.
